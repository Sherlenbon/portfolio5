# Abstract

In order to meet the actual needs of the majority of fitness and weight-loss people, providing them with a platform for friendly communication and helping them develop the habit of insisting on exercise or diet control, based on cloud development, I designed and developed a mini-program of sharing and punching system for fitness people. On the basis of introducing the mini-program and cloud development, the overall design scheme is presented, and the operation effect of the system is shown. By logging into the system, users can easily achieve functions of posting, punching, commenting, hitting ‘likes’ for others and so on, featuring humanization and strong interaction.
